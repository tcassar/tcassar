## Some Cool Projects

### Per-Compartment Syscall Filtering
- Final Year Project
- Research into system call filtering in compartmentalised applications such that each compartment has its own syscall filter to reduce attack surface
- Investigate to what extent introducing a custom filter for each shared library could reduce attack surface
    - Custom tool implemented in bpf + golang
    - [github.com/tcassar-diss/syso](https://github.com/tcassar-diss/syso)
- Aiming to modify `seccomp` to support finer grained filtering in [Unikraft](https://unikraft.org/) or in the Linux kernel (tbd).
